<!--v1.5-->Enter missing values/overview
Here you can see an overview of all clients that will be created. Please enter missing values and correct false values.

<u>Change the number of clients</u>
You can change the number of clients by entering a new value in the field <i>"$I18N_client_amount"</i>. Click on <i>"$I18N_refresh"</i> if you want to lower the amount or on <i>"$I18N_regenerateValues"</i> to increase.
<i>"$I18N_regenerateValues"</i> can generate new values or read additional lines from the database file, whereas <i>"$I18N_refresh"</i> can only delete clients. If there are not enough lines in the database file, these values have to be entered by hand. The generation of a huge amount of values can take a long time. E.g. "pinging" of clients.

To start the installation click on <i>"$I18N_save"</i>.
