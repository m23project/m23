<!--v1.3-->Select the client distribution
<u>Information:</u>
A distribution is a composition of different software packages stored on CDs, DVDs or in the internet. Some of these distributions are free software and available for free download. E.g. <a href="http://www.debian.org" target="_blank">Debian</a> is a free Linux distribution. Distributions differentiate in the installation program and the eye candy of the desktop only. There are no significant differences. The selection of a certain distribution is mostly a matter of taste. This dialog makes it possible to install different distributions with m23.
