<!-- V1.2 -->After adding a new client, the client will boot over the network and runs through a hardware detection sequence. Hardware data (hard disk size, partitions etc.) will be sent to the server. When the data transfer is finished the client will change its status to <i>"yellow"</i>. You can setup your client now. To setup your client click on <i>"$I18N_clients"</i> &rarr; <i>"$I18N_setup"</i> in the menu.
