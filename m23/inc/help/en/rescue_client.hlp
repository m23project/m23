<!--v1.3-->Start rescue system
If you want to start a client for repairing or diagnostic purpose, you can boot the rescue system over the network. After the network boot the client starts a console that allows you to do your work. To start the rescue system click on <i>"$I18N_rescueSystem"</i> after the client name.

<u>Hint</u>:
The rescue system will be started every time you boot the client until you delete the "m23Rescue" job from the job list. You can find the list <!-- V1.7 new --> on the page <i>"$I18N_overview_clients"</i><!-- V1.7 new end--> if you click on the number in the "$I18N_jobs" line.
