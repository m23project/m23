<!-- 17.1 new-->$I18N_definite_delete_client

Here you can remove the selected m23 client. The deletion will result in the client being removed from the m23 database, but the client itself will not be modified. After deletion, you will no longer be able to administer the client with m23. To perfom a deletion, click on <i>"$I18N_delete"</i>.

If the m23 client you would like to delete is a virtual machine that was created by m23, you can optionally remove its files, too, if you check the option <i>"$I18N_deleteVMToo"</i>. The machine will then be lost irretrievably.

<u>Note:</u>
If you would like to completely remove any connections between the m23 client and the m23 server (removal of m23 init scripts, m23 hardware detection and APT package proxy, if applicable), execute the commands listed in <i>"$I18N_commandsForDem23ing"</i> as root on the client (after it has been deleted from the m23 database).
