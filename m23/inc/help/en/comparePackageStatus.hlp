$I18N_comparePackageStatus<!--new 17.1 -->

This dialog allows you to compare the package status between two clients. For the comparison, select the data sources for the left and the right column at <i>"$I18N_clientOrFileSelection1"</i> und <i>"$I18N_clientOrFileSelection2"</i>. If you have accessed this dialog from the <i>"$I18N_overview_clients"</i> page, the first two clients that have been selected on that page will be preselected. If instead you want to do a comparison between a different set of clients, please select them from the corresponding list and click on <i>"$I18N_useClientName"</i>. If you would like to use a previously saved package status file, please select it and upload it. It is possible to compare between two clients, two package status files or a client and a package status file.

To start the comparison, click on <i>"$I18N_comparePackageStatus"</i>.

The comparison takes the package names, version numbers and installation status into account. This information, if available, will be listed in the respective columns <i>"$I18N_package_name"</i>, <i>"$I18N_version"</i> and <i>"$I18N_status"</i>. In the column <i>"&lt;=|&gt;"</i>, you can see if the package is available only in the left (<i>"&lt;"</i>) or right (<i>"&gt;"</i>) column or if no match could be found (<i>"|"</i>). If the package exists on both sides (<i>"="</i>), version numbers and installation status will also be compared. Differences that have been found will be highlighted by color. At the end of the table, a summary of the comparison will be displayed.
