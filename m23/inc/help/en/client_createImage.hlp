$I18N_createImage<!--V 1.11 new-->

You can create images from a partition or a whole drive of your client in this dialog. This image can be used to install clients. Select your preferred $I18N_imageFormat, the $I18N_imageTransferType and the $I18N_imageCompression. You have to make additional designations under <i>"$I18N_imageSource"</i> for some image formats e.g. the partition or drive that should be stored in the image.

<!--V13.3 begin-->At <i>"$I18N_imageFormat"</i> select the desired format, at <i>"$I18N_imageTransferType"</i> the network transfer type and at <i>"$I18N_imageCompression"</i> the kind of compression. At <i>"$I18N_imageSource"</i>, select the partition or hard disk that you would like to use.<!--V13.3 end--> Choose a name for the image and enter it at <i>"$I18N_imageName"</i>. Click on <i>"$I18N_createImage"</i> afterwards.

<!--V13.2 begin-->You can access the overview about all created image files at <i>"Server settings"</i> &rarr; <i>"$I18N_manageImageFiles"</i>, where it is also possible to delete image files which are no longer needed.
If you would like to use the image file which you created here for the installation of a client, please select <i>"Imaging"</i> as client distribution during client <i>"Setup"</i>.<!--V13.2 end-->

<!--V11.4 begin--><u><b>Caution</b></u>
The client will <b>reboot immediately</b> after clicking on <i>"$I18N_createImage"</i> and before it begins to create the image! Data that has not been saved before <b>will be lost</b>.<!--V11.4 end-->

<u>Hint for image files</u>
The files are stored in the directory <b>/m23/data+scripts/clientImages</b> in different types and with distinct compressions. The file names are always created after the following scheme: &lt;Image name&gt;&lt;Size of the extracted image in bytes&gt;&lt;Image format&gt;&lt;Compression&gt;
Image format is one of the following values:

<!--V13.3 begin--><ul><LI><a href="http://partclone.org/" target="_blank"><b>Partclone</b></a>: For a partition whose file system is supported, only the used sectors will be saved, else the whole disk.</LI></ul><!--V13.3 end-->
<ul><LI><a href="index.php?page=manViewer&manPage=dd" target="_blank"><b>dd</b></a>: Saves the whole data of a partition or harddisk.</LI></ul>
For the compression the following is valid:
<ul><LI>(no extension): The image file will be stored with no compression.</LI>
<LI><a href="index.php?page=manViewer&manPage=gzip" target="_blank"><b>gz</b></a>: The image will be compressed with  gzip.</LI>
<LI><a href="index.php?page=manViewer&manPage=bzip2" target="_blank"><b>bz2</b></a>: It will be compressed with bzip2 that compresses better mostly.</LI></ul>

<u>Hint for the $I18N_transferPort</u>
You have to enter a network port that can be used on client and server side and is not blocked (e.g. firewall) for the $I18N_imageTransferType. If you want to create images from multiple clients concurrently you have to choose different port numbers.
