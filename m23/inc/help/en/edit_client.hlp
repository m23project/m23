Change client<!--V1.10 new-->
In this dialog you can change the settings of a client. There are the edit lines you may allready know from the "Add a new client" dialog and three extra rows. These rows are used to select what should happen with the entered values.

<ul><LI><b>Left row</b>: Select this row if you want to keep the value that is stored on the client and/or the server.</LI>
<li><b>Middle row</b>: The changes should be made on the client and transferred to the server afterwards.</li>
<li><b>Right row</b>: The value is only written to the database on the server. This is useful if you made changes on client side by hand.</li></ul>

<u>Hint</u>
Some settings are only stored on the server. That's why these settings can't be made on the client. You can't select the middle row on those settings.
