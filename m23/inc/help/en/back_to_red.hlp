$I18N_back_to_red<!--new v12.4-->
This function allows you to shift the client's status back to the status it had directly after it has been added (and before its setup, keeping the network settings etc.). The client does a reboot and initiates the hardware detection. When this is accomplished, you can partition and format the client anew and assign an operating system to it under <i>"$I18N_setup"</i >.
