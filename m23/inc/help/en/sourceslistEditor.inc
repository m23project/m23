<ul>
	<li><b>Loading a package source</b>: Select a package source from the list (top/right) and click on <i>"$I18N_load"</i>. The package source will be loaded in the editor.</li>
	<li><b>Deletion a package source</b>: To delete the package source loaded in the editor, click on the <i>"$I18N_delete"</i> button and accept your decision in the next dialog.</li>
	<li><b>Saving a package source</b>: The system will always save the package source loaded in the editor. It doesn't matter which package source is selected in the list. <!-- V1.8 begin -->After you have selected a distribution, it is possible that you need to specify your choice. Choose a user interface from the list displayed under the editor <!-- V11.3 begin -->and select the architecture(s) supported by the package sources list under <i>"$I18N_arch"</i>.<!-- V11.3 end --><!-- V1.8 end --> Think about a good name for your package source and enter it below <i>"$I18N_packageSourceName"</i>. If you have loaded a package source before, the package source name is written into the field <i>"$I18N_packageSourceName"</i> automatically. If you want, you can enter a comment into the <i>"$I18N_description"</i> text field. Afterwards, click on the <i>"$I18N_save"</i> button.</li>
	<li><b>Test the package source</b>: After entering a package source list, you should test if all sources are working properly. Simply click on the <i>"Test"</i> button. The package description files will be downloaded and a test report will be shown thereafter. It can take minutes until the report is shown, depending on your internet connection speed and the speed of the used software package servers.</li>
	<!-- V1.6 add -->
	<li><b>Select Mirror</b>: If you would like to use a different mirror (the standard server is ftp.debian.org) for the installation of the base system, enter it as follows in a new line of your package source: <code>#mirror: [URL to the packages]</code>. <i>URL to the packages</i> describes the protocol, the hostname or the IP and the directory that contains the packages. A valid URL may look like this: <code>#mirror: http://192.168.7.14/debianCDs</code>.</li><!-- V1.6 add -->
	<!-- V11.5 begin --><li><b>Create configuration files</b>: Every package sources list offers the option to create additional files (e.g. for package manager configuration). For every file you wish to add, add a new line following this syntax: 
        <code>#addToFile:[file name with full path to file]###[1. line]###[2. line]</code>.
        Replace Ersetzen Sie hierbei <i>"[file name with full path to file]"</i> by the correct value (e.g. /etc/apt/preferences). The lines in the output file from the package sources list will be separated by three hash signs (###) instead of linebreaks, as the command to creat a file must be given in a single line.</li>
        <li><b>Supported file systems</b>: Every distribution offers support for a number of file systems. These can vary from distribution to distribution. Please list the supported file systems in a separate line:
        <code>#supportedFS: [file system 1], [file system 2], [file system 3]</code>
        Each line can contain any number of file systems (separated by comma and space) (e.g. <code>#supportedFS: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs</code>).
        If you select an unsupported file system when formatting a client, the file system will automatically be adapted to one that is supported when the formatting process starts. This fallback file system must be indicated with the line
        <code>#alternativeFS: [file system]</code> (e.g. <code>#alternativeFS: ext3</code>).</li><!-- V11.5 end -->
