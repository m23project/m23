<u>Searching keywords</u>
You can search the list of clients using a search term. At <i>"$I18N_searchLine"</i>, enter the term that must be contained in the properties (e.g. client name, ip address, cpu type, etc.) of the client(s). Click on <i>"$I18N_search"</i> to run the search. The key word search has priority over the search that is based on the filter rules. For as long as a search term is used, any filter rules will be ignored. Click on <i>"$I18N_removeSearchFilter"</i> to activate the filter-based search or to see the complete list of clients.

<u>Filter-based search</u>
You can use filter rules to limit the number of clients that are displayed in the list. At <i>"$I18N_filter"</i>, choose the property you would like to filter the list by. Everytime you select something, a new filter will be added. Depending on the property, you can add more parameters to the filter. When you would like to remove a filter, click on <i>"-"</i> in the corresponding line. At <i>"$I18N_sorting"</i>, you can choose the property by which the client list is to be sorted in ascending or descending order. Click on <i>"$I18N_search"</i>, to apply the filter.<!-- V20.1 end -->
