$I18N_m23RemoteAdministrationService<!--new v11.5-->

After you have imported the remote administration service code successfully, you can now activate the tunnels for the remote administration service of goos-habermann.de. After the activation, the support of goos-habermann.de can access your m23 server and help you with your administrative duties. As long as the tunnels are open, the support of goos-habermann.de has  <b> the same rights as a local m23 server administrator</b>.

In <i>"$I18N_RASStatus"</i>, you can see the current state of both tunnels (<i>"$I18N_sshTunnel"</i> and <i>"$I18N_wwwTunnel"</i>). To update the status messages, click on <i>"$I18N_refresh"</i>.

To <b>open</b> the tunnel connections, click on <i>"$I18N_daemonStart"</i>, to <b>close</b> them, click on <i>"$I18N_daemonStop"</i>.

If you do not want to continue to use the remote administration service, you can remove the data of the remote administration service from you m23 server by clicking on <i>"$I18N_remove"</i>. To be able to use the service anew, you need to reimport the activation code.
