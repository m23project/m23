$I18N_redo_client_jobs<!--new v16.3-->
Here you can repeat all jobs (including partitioning and formatting) which have ever been executed on the client. In contrast to <i>"$I18N_recover_client"</i>, there will be no additional job created that ensures that all packages previously installed on the client will be installed again. Additionally, all identical jobs are merged into a single one.
