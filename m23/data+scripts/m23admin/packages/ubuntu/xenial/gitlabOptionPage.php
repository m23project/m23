 Enabling https means that an SSL certificate is required to access this Gitlab
 instance (as Nginx will be configured to respond only to https requests). A
 self-signed certificate is enough for local testing (and can be generated
 using, for instance, the package easy-rsa), but it is not recommended for a
 production instance.
 .
 Some certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt (letsencrypt.org), StartSSL
 (startssl.com) or WoSign (buy.wosign.com/free) offer free SSL certificates.
 .
 Nginx must be reloaded after the certificate and key files are made available
 at /etc/gitlab/ssl. letsencrypt package may be used to automate interaction
 with Letâ€™s Encrypt to obtain a certificate.

 Symbolic links to certificate and key created using letsencrypt package

 selected.
 .
 Otherwise, certificate and key files have to be placed manually to
 /etc/gitlab/ssl directory as 'gitlab.crt' and 'gitlab.key'.
 .
 Nginx will be stopped, if this option is selected, to allow letsencrypt to use
 ports 80 and 443 during domain ownership validation and certificate retrieval
 step.
 .
 Note: letsencrypt does not have a usable nginx plugin currently, so
 certificates must be renewed manually after 3 months, when current
 letsencrypt certificate expire.
