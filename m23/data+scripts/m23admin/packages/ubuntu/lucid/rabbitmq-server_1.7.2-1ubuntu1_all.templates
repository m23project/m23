Description: Upgrading from 1.5.4 and below.
 You are upgrading from a release prior to 1.6.0. When the
 RabbitMQ server detects the presence of an old database, it moves it
 to a backup location, creates a fresh, empty database, and logs a
 warning. If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data then we
 recommend you contact support@rabbitmq.com for assistance with the
 upgrade.
