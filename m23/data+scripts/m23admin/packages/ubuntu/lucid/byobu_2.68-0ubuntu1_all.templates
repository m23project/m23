Description: Do you want to launch Byobu at shell login for all users?
 Byobu can launch automatically at login (e.g. console, ssh), providing
 an attachable/detachable window manager on the command line.
 .
 If you select this option, Byobu will install a symlink in /etc/profile.d.
 This setting is system-wide, for all users logging into the system.
 Individual users can disable this by touching ~/.byobu/disable-autolaunch,
 or configuring with 'byobu-config'.
