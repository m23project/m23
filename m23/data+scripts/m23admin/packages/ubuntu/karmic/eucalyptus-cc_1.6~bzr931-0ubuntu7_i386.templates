Template: eucalyptus/cluster-name
Type: string
Description: Eucalyptus cluster name:
 Enter a name for this cluster. The name should contain only ASCII letters,
 digits, hyphens, and underscores. It will be shown to users as the name of
 an availability zone.

Template: eucalyptus/subnet
Type: string
Default: 172.19.0.0
Description: Choose a subnet for your UEC instances:
 The subnet should be set to an IP subnet that is free for eucalyptus to use
 (i.e. no other system connected to your network directly is configured with
 addresses from this subnet).
 .
 Examples: 192.168.144.0, 172.17.0.0, 10.0.0.0

Template: eucalyptus/netmask
Type: string
Default: 255.255.0.0
Description: Choose a netmask for your UEC instances:
 The netmask of subnet you specified.
 .
 Examples: 255.255.255.0, 255.255.240.0, 255.255.0.0

Template: eucalyptus/dns
Type: string
Default: 192.168.144.0
Description: Choose a DNS for your UEC instances:
 The DNS should be set to the IP address of a DNS server that your systems use
 (usually safe to use the same DNS that is configured on the front-end). 

Template: eucalyptus/publicips
Type: string
Default:
Description: Provide a list of "public" IP's for your instances:
 Eucalyptus requires a pool of IP addresses that can be dynamically assigned as
 the "public" IPs of virtual machines.  These IPs must be unused within their
 Class C subnet, this system must have an interface configured with an address
 on this subnet, and your prospective users must be able to connect to these
 IPs from wherever they run the client tools.
 .
 Please specify one or more ranges of IP addresses, e.g.:
  192.168.1.100-192.168.1.199
 or
  192.168.2.50-192.168.2.99 192.168.2.150-192.168.2.199
 .
 You may leave this blank if you have no IP addresses available, BUT you and
 your users must then request the private addressing scheme when starting a
 virtual machine instance. For ec2-run-instances and euca-run-instances, this
 is done with the option "--addressing private".

Template: eucalyptus/addrspernet
Type: string
Default: 32
Description: Choose number of addresses per network/security group:
 The number of addresses can be used to limit the number of instances that can
 be attached to each named security group simultaneously.

Template: eucalyptus/mode
Type: select
Default: MANAGED-NOVLAN
Choices: STATIC, SYSTEM, MANAGED, MANAGED-NOVLAN
Description: Select the networking mode for your cluster:
 MANAGED and MANAGED-NOVLAN configure eucalyptus to fully manage
 the VM networks, and enables the ability to use EBS, security groups
 and dynamic public IP assignment (with and without vlan tagging of
 security group networks, respectively).
 .
 In STATIC mode, you can manually configure a set of IP addresses that will be
 allocated to VMs at boot time in a first come, first served manner.
 .
 If you would like UEC to not manage the VM network at all, choose SYSTEM.  In
 this mode, VM interfaces are attached directly to your physical ethernet by
 way of a bridge, at which point they will typically invoke a DHCP client to
 aquire an IP address.  Use this mode if you wish to manage VM IPs yourself, or
 allow the VMs to pick up an IP from a non-UEC managed DHCP server.
