Template: cobbler/password
Type: password
Description: New password for the "cobbler" user:
 It is highly recommended that you set a password for the
 administrative "cobbler" user.
 .
 You can also run password reconfiguration later by executing
 'dpkg-reconfigure -plow cobbler'.
 .
 Note that you can easily add users to cobbler later with:
  sudo htdigest /etc/cobbler/users.digest "Cobbler" USERNAME

Template: cobbler/server_and_next_server
Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
Description: Set the Boot and PXE server IP address:
 For kickstart and PXE features to work properly, it is
 important to set the correct IP addresses in the fields
 "server" and "next_server" in  "/etc/cobbler/settings".
 .
 The "server" field must be set to something other than
 localhost, or kickstart features will not work.  This should
 be a resolvable hostname or IP for the boot server as
 reachable by all machines that will use it.
 .
 The "next_server" field must be set to something other than
 127.0.0.1, and should match the IP address of the boot server
 on the PXE network.
 .
 Note that these values will try to be automatically detected,
 however they can be manually edited in "/etc/cobbler/settings".
