Description: What news server should be used for reading and posting news?
 trn is configured to read news via an NNTP connection, and needs to know
 the fully-qualified host name of the server (such as news.example.com). If
 you have a local news spool, you should consider installing some NNTP
 server like inn2; in that case, enter "localhost" as your news server.
