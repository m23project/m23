Description: Ubuntu MAAS PXE/Provisioning network address:
 The Ubuntu MAAS Server automatically detects the IP address
 that is used for PXE and provisioning. However, it needs to be
 in the same network as the clients. If the automatically
 detected address is not in the same network as the clients, it
 must be changed.
