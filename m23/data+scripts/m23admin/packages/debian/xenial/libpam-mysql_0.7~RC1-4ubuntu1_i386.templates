Description: Chmod configuration file?
 This version of pam-mysql has a configuration file which may include
 passwords. Do you want to disable normal users from reading this
 file? 
 .
 There is probably no good reason *not* to do this. As the most common
 reason to use the configuration file is to hide the password.
