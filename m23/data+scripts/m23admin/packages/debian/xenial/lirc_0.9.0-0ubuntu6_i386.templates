Template: lirc/remote
Type: select
Choices: None, Custom${REMOTES}
Default: None
Description: Remote control configuration:
 If you choose a remote or transmitter, but already have a
 configuration file in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf, the existing
 file will be renamed to /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.dpkg-old and
 the community configurations loaded into
 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.  If you have a
 /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.dpkg-old file already, it will not
 be overwritten and your current /etc/lirc/lircd.conf will
 be lost.

Template: lirc/transmitter
Type: select
Choices: None, Custom${TRANSMITTERS}
Default: None
Description: IR transmitter, if present:
 IR transmitters can be used for controlling external devices.  Some
 devices are considered transceivers, with the ability to both send
 and receive.  Other devices require separate hardware to accomplish
 these tasks.

Template: lirc/dev_input_device
Type: select
Choices: /dev/lirc0${EVENTS}
Default: /dev/lirc0
Description: Custom event interface for your dev/input device:
 Many remotes that were previously supported by the lirc_gpio interface now
 need to be set up via the dev/input interface.  You will need to custom
 select your remote's event character device.  This can be determined by
 'cat /proc/bus/input/devices'.

Template: lirc/serialport
Type: select
Choices: /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1
Default: /dev/ttyS0
Description: Port your serial device is attached to:
 The UART (serial) driver is a low level driver that takes advantage
 of bit banging a character device.  This means that you can only use it
 with hardware serial devices.  It unfortunately does not work with USB
 serial devices.
