This menue helps you to generate the development guide.

generate: Fetches comments from the source files and uses hand written
documentation to build the development guide in HTML and PDF format.

upload: Uploads the development guide to SF. If you want to use the upload
entry you have to modify the upload script in 
/mdk/doc/devguide/bin/menuDevguide. You may want to change the host, user
password or the copy command. If you want to use FTP for uploading, you may
use the "ncftpput" tool.
